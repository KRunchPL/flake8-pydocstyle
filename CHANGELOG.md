0.2.0 - 2021-11-28
===================

Initial release.

Runs `pydocstyle` when `flake8` is running.
Runs it as it would be run without any parameters in the command line, so it respects all configuration file options that you can set for example in `pyproject.toml`.

End-to-end tests were done completely manually with latest `pydocstyle` version (6.1.1)
